        strictly prohibited. Shill.lol’ trademarks, trade dress and other
        intellectual property may not be used in connection with any product or
        service that is not Shill.lol’, in any manner that is likely to cause
        confusion among customers, or in any manner that disparages or

        our Privacy Policy, which explains our practices and also governs your
        use of Shill.lol Services. Our Privacy Policy is available here. RISK OF
        LOSS, RETURNS/REFUNDS & TITLE The risk of loss and title for items
        purchased by you from Shill.lol pass to you upon our delivery of the
        items to the carrier. Conversely, we do not take title to returned items
        until the item is received at our fulfillment center. At our discretion,
        a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, we
        do not take title to the refunded item. You are responsible for
        reviewing the contents of your returns prior to shipment back to us. We
        are not responsible for any additional items that might accompany your
        returned items. Any such items are subject to destruction, and we have
        no obligation to return them to you. PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS; TYPOGRAPHICAL
        ERRORS; SITE CONTENT Shill.lol attempts to be as accurate as possible.
        However, Shill.lol does not warrant that product descriptions or other
        content of any Shill.lol Service is 100% accurate, complete, reliable,
        current, or error-free. If a product offered is not as described, your
        sole remedy against us is to return it in unused condition and request a
        refund for such item. If any other Shill.lol Service is not as
        described, your sole remedy against us is to request a refund for such
        Shill.lol Service. In the event a product or service is listed at an
        incorrect price or with incorrect information (due to typographical
        error or error in pricing or product information received from our
        suppliers), we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders
        placed for such product or service. We shall have the right to refuse or
        cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and
        your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged
        for the purchase and your order is canceled, we will issue a credit to
        your credit card account in the amount of the charge. Content provided
        on shill.lol is solely for informational purposes. It is your sole
        responsibility to consult a licensed physician or qualified health care

        related condition or before engaging in any physical activity using our
        products or services, if appropriate.

        DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY Shill.lol SERVICES AND ALL
        INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) AND OTHER
        SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH
        Shill.lol SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS,
        UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. Shill.lol MAKES NO
        REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE
        OPERATION OF Shill.lol SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS,
        PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE
        MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH Shill.lol SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE
        SPECIFIED IN WRITING. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF Shill.lol
        SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW,
        Shill.lol DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
        NOT LIMITED TO, DATA ACCURACY, DATA SECURITY, AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
        MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. shop.lol MAY
        INCLUDE INACCURACIES, MISTAKES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. WE DO NOT
        WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. WE DO NOT
        WARRANT THAT Shill.lol SERVICES, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS,
        PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE
        MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH Shill.lol SERVICES, SERVERS OR ELECTRONIC
        COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM Shill.lol ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL
        COMPONENTS. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, Shill.lol WILL NOT BE
        LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF ANY Shill.lol
        SERVICE, OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS
        (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE
        AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH ANY Shill.lol SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
        LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL
        DAMAGES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
        PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES
        (REGARDLESS OF THE FOUNDATION FOR THE ACTION) SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE
        AMOUNT YOU PAID US FOR THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. DISPUTES,
        REMEDIES & APPLICABLE LAW Any dispute or claim relating in any way to
        your use of any Shill.lol Service, or to any products or services sold
        or distributed by Shill.lol or through shill.lol or any other Shill.lol
        website will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court.
        You agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and
        the laws of the state of Florida (without regard to principles of
        conflict of laws), will govern these Terms of Service and Conditions of
        Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and
        Shill.lol. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of
        an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an
        individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including
        injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow
        the terms of these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use. Any
        arbitration between us will be conducted by the American Arbitration
        Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary
        Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available
        at www.adr.org. The AAA's rules will govern payment of all filing,
        administration and arbitrator fees. The arbitration will be conducted in
        person in Miami-Dade County, Florida, at another mutually agreed-upon
        location, or through such other procedures (such as, without limitation,
        written submissions, phone or video attendance) as may be agreed by the
        parties and approved by the arbitrator(s). You and Shill.lol both agree
        that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an
        individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative
        action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in
        arbitration you and Shill.lol each respectively waive any right to a
        jury trial. You and Shill.lol also both agree that either of us may
        bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of
        intellectual property rights.
